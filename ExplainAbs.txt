Abstraction plays a big part when it comes to programming. When it comes to Abstraction,
It only hows the required information to the user. while the rest of the information of 
the program is hidden. It simplifies the program and organizes the program to different
segments. Which provide organize and neet codes. 

For example

The Journal program, We have the main program then the sub-programs.
program(Main)

Journal(Sub)

Entry(Sub)

Prompt(Sub)


With this the user will only see the program and the rest is hidden away. Still the 
rest of the program which is hidden away is still important without it, it's either 
Filled with errors or the program will be filled with all of the combine code nessesary.
