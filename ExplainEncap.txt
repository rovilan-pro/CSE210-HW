Encapsulation involves batching up data and methods that operates in a single unit. a class for example.
The Likes of this are examples private and public. which prevents external code from altering internal code. 
Which maintain consistency to the said program.

For example
public class Word
{
    private string _text;
    public bool IsHidden { get; private set; }

    public Word(string text)
    {
        _text = text;
        IsHidden = false;
    }

    public void Hide()
    {
        IsHidden = true;
    }

    public string GetDisplayText()
    {
        return IsHidden ? "____" : _text;
    }
}

we can see that the privated _text is only to be used to its class while the rest which is public, 
can be accessible to the program in your project.
