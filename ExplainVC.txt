Version Control System also known as VCS, Helps people and team collaborators track changes in a program/project. 
It also simplifies the work that has to be done, also undone mistakes or changes that occured, and track the history
that take place and when it happened.

Let us use the README.md which is provided in this repository for example to truly deepen our understanding. after all 
a example is the best way for us to truly understand things. 

At first the program/project README.md only contains this set of words.
# CSE 210

As you can see in Github a web compilations of program, 
There are no changes. so we will use Git for it to apply changes that occured in VScode.
Let us do it in the most easiest way possible for me aleast.
First We create a repository if theres no repository yet.
after that in VScode We can Clone the repository, Then input the code.

Now we create changes in VScode
# CSE 210
# Rovilan Alec Dela Torre

Here is the fun part.
Click Source Control, if you want to stage changes click the plus sign. if you want to remove it click the minus sign.
then after the changes there is a rectangle with words "message" input a message for example "Added Name",
Then click commit then sync and you will see changes.

If You want to see if the changes applied.
You can also check the terminal in VScode to be sure if changes truly applied or see the program's status.
Input in terminal this code
# git status

you can also see the changes, codes to input if you want to add or restore the file for example
to add do 
# git add README.md
then # git push
to restore 
# git restore README.md
