Inheritance is a process where you no longer need to rewrite the same class, 
if multiple classes shares similar characteristics.
For example in a Class you have Assignment and you also had MathAssignment. 
Instead of rewriting all the properties and methods that both classes share, 
MathAssignment can inherit them from Assignment.

For example:

Base class
public class Assignment
{
    private string _studentName;
    private string _topic;

    public Assignment(string studentName, string topic)
    {
        _studentName = studentName;
        _topic = topic;
    }

    public string GetStudentName()
    {
        return _studentName;
    }

    public string GetTopic()
    {
        return _topic;
    }

    public string GetSummary()
    {
        return _studentName + " - " + _topic;
    }
}

This is the Base class it contains the code that can be reused in MathAssignment.

Sub class
public class MathAssignment : Assignment
{
    private string _textbookSection;
    private string _problems;

    public MathAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string textbookSection, string problems)
        : base(studentName, topic)
    {
        _textbookSection = textbookSection;
        _problems = problems;
    }

    public string GetHomeworkList()
    {
        return $"Section {_textbookSection} Problems {_problems}";
    }
}

This is the sub class we can see that the codes are more simplier and organized.
